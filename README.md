### Hi there 👋  

I’m **Suneet Maharana**, a senior undergraduate at **IIT Kanpur**, deeply passionate about the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Product Engineering**. My work focuses on building scalable, intelligent systems that merge technical depth with tangible human impact — from **Agentic AI** and **MCP-based architectures** to **data-driven research** in materials science and financial modeling.  

Over time, I’ve explored how data can be transformed into decisions that shape real-world outcomes. From developing **multilingual AI chatbots** that serve 10,000+ farmers with real-time agri insights, to integrating **LangChain**, **XGBoost**, and **FastAPI** pipelines for predictive modeling, I thrive on creating systems that are both analytical and actionable.  

I’ve had the opportunity to work across diverse domains — AI data engineering, product strategy, and applied research. At **Mrittika AI**, I built an **Agentic MCP server** combining multimodal APIs and ML pipelines; at **Saltmine**, I engineered **LLM-powered workspace automation** with the Gemini API; and at **BCG**, I developed **GPT-driven analytics pipelines** to accelerate a ₹1,300 Cr EV market strategy.  

My academic research complements this applied side. I’ve co-authored papers in **Applied Physics Reviews** and **Journal of Materials Chemistry A**, advancing data-driven discovery of thermally potent materials — bridging AI with fundamental science. I enjoy moving fluidly between experimentation and implementation, turning abstract concepts into deployable, high-impact systems.  

Beyond code, I’m drawn to building **AI-powered products** and exploring how **LLMs, MCP frameworks, and modern data infrastructures** can reimagine the way we interact with information and automation. Whether it’s optimizing user experiences through AI or accelerating discovery through data, I’m always striving to build something meaningful — one model, one experiment, one product at a time.
